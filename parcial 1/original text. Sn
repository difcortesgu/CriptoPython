Quirrells too scared to back us up Snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think theyll believe him or us Its not exactly a secret we hate him Dumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked Filch wouldnt help us if his life depended on it hes too friendly with Snape and the more students get thrown out the better hell think And dont forget were not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy Thatll take a lot of explaining Hermione looked convinced but Ron didnt If we just do a bit of poking around No said Harry flatly weve done enough poking around He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons The following morning notes were delivered to Harry Hermione and Neville at the breakfast table They were all the same: Your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight Meet Mr Filch in the entrance hall Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points theyd lost He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didnt say a word Like Harry she felt they deserved what theyd got At eleven oclock that night they said goodbye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville Filch was already there and so was Malfoy Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention too Follow me said Filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside I bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule again wont you eh he said leering at them Oh yes hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me Its just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days Ive got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case theyre ever needed Right off we go and dont think of running off now itll be worse for you if you do They marched off across the dark grounds Neville kept sniffing Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be It must be something really horrible or Filch wouldnt be sounding so delighted The moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness Ahead Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrids hut Then they heard a distant shout Is that you Filch Hurry up I want ter get started Harrys heart rose  if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldnt be so bad His relief must have showed in his face because Filch said I suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that oaf Well think again boy its into the forest youre going and Im much mistaken if youll all come out in one piece At this Neville let out a little moan and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks The forest he repeated and he didnt sound quite as cool as usual We cant go in there at night theres all sorts of things in there werewolves I heard Neville clutched the sleeve of Harrys robe and made a choking noise Thats your problem isnt it said Filch his voice cracking with glee Shouldve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldnt you Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark Fang at his heel He was carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder Abou time he said I bin waitin fer half an hour already All right Harry Hermione I shouldnt be too friendly to them Hagrid said Filch coldly theyre here to be punished after all Thats why yer late is it said Hagrid frowning at Filch Bin lecturin them eh Snot your place ter do that Yehve done yer bit Ill take over from here Ill be back at dawn said Filch for whats left of them he added nastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the darkness Malfoy now turned to Hagrid Im not going in that forest he said and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts said Hagrid fiercely Yehve done wrong an now yehve got ter pay fer it But this is servant stuff its not for students to do I thought wed be copying lines or something if my father knew I was doing this hed tell yer thats how it is at Hogwarts Hagrid growled Copyin lines  What goods that ter anyone Yehll do summat useful or Yehll get out If yeh think yer fatherd rather you were expelled then get back off ter the castle an pack Go on Malfoy didnt move He looked at Hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze Right then said Hagrid now listen carefully cause its dangerous what were gonna do tonight an I don want no one takin risks Follow me over here a moment He led them to the very edge of the forest Holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest Look there said Hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground Silvery stuff Thats unicorn blood Theres a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat This is the second time in a week I found one dead last Wednesday Were gonna try an find the poor thing We might have ter put it out of its misery And what if whatever hurt the unicorn
